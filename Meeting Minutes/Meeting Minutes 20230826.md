## Agenda
- Project Status
	- Ellie's Research
	- Curtis' VM build
	- Daniel's Machine Learning
- Proposal (Assignment) Status
- eJournal Reminder
- Daniel's Meeting with Yibe
- Curtis' upcoming meeting with Yibe
## Discussion
- Curtis built graphical environment, and tested RDP access (working)
	- NS3 interactions are still causing strife, however
- Daniel has allocated time to undertake proposal (and project) work
- Daniel stressed to Curtis that should there be any issues, Curtis can call/get in contact with him to work through them "any time you're working on it", rather than focusing on reporting and documentation (current process wasting too much time)
	- Daniel indicated the next "couple weeks" were quite open, on his schedule
- Daniel posited if Ellie's research should be more generalised, rather than so narrowly focused on AODV and NS3 topics
	- Curtis suggested looking into general themes of implementation/goal for similar research projects (e.g. black hole networks in traditional LANs/WANs), and finding a point of differentiation to that (e.g. focus on IoT networks) - Yibe may have hinted at his desired novelty with keeping "power consumption" in mind
- Proposal template updated to reflect Responsibilities of each member in-document, rather than listed in separate document that members need to refer to
- Daniel is keep to fill out the Gantt Chart for Annexure A, based on current Github project items/board
- Daniel stated he was eager to test out modelling, once he receives access to the VM/instance
- Curtis reiterated a possible flow to filling out the Proposal document
## Action Items
- Curtis confirm with Yibe access for group to final azure instance
- Daniel to read and understand Ellie's notes on Research papers reviewed, and provide feedback to her
- Curtis to confirm with Yibe some novelty of project - focus on IoT networks, rather than traditional LANs?
- All members to submit eJournals on time
- All members to fill out their respective Proposal tasks on template
- Curtis to read Ellie's research notes
## Other Business
