Group: 9785-23-7
Date & Time: Monday 14/8/23, 3:45pm - 4:00pm
Present: Curtis, Ellie, Maryam
Apologies: Daniel
Method: Physical; UC 6B48
Next Meeting: Saturday 19/8/23, afternoon

## Agenda
- Our group # is 23, Tutorial allocation is not with Maryam (Maryam #25+)
- More in depth discussion on nature of mentor for this kind of project
- Frequency of meetings with Mentor
- Usual frequency of meetings with sponsor
	- Sponsor is highly accessible via email, but as yet unsure of physical availability
- Github Project pages
	- Maryam added as "collaborator" for public repository, though her status as mentor may preclude her from interacting directly with the repository (not necessarily the same limitation for the Github Project)
- Yibe provided access to Azure instance
	- Need to chase up with him, though - short access timeframe; possibly only so I can configure for GUI, then capture template for that, for group testing
	- Need to confirm specs of Azure VM - keep within budget of Capstone project allowance ($350)
		- When not testing, we can turn off the VM, which will limit costs
- 
## Discussion
- Different groups don't matter for mentors-to-tutorials/workshops
- Maryam happy to help with project proposal writing, etc. Procedural (for capstone project admin), etc.
- Maryam can spend a total of 2 hours on helping the group
- Maryam requested we send her an email detailing the roles of each group member
- Record/save email chains
## Action Items
- Any group member to send Maryam an email detailing the roles/responsibilities of each group member
- Members to record email chains for saving to project/MS Teams repository
	- Only submit whole chain; wait until chain is complete before uploading (unless happy to clear up old versions for new uploads)
## Other Business
- Commentary (paraphrased) from Maryam: "This group seems to be well on track / going really well - focus on getting to know each other"
	- In essence, it's still pretty early days, project-wise - building the relationships and getting a grasp on time management is the focus at this point in the semester/unit
